# Raspump Remote

This is the server software to control a pump remotely using Raspberry Pi. This is one
of many parts of the stack. The other 3 are the local server, the control software (the GUI),
and the Pi driver (installed on the Pi itself).

See the test directory for the API. To run test: `npm test`. Redis-server required.
